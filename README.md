Phaddon
=======

Phaddon is a simple "app store" for user content.
It can run on most any PHP host.

Installation
------------

The contents of the `www` folder should be placed in the web root.
The `data` folder should go next to the web root.
Make sure the web server has permission to access all files.

For example:

    User root
     |
     |- webroot      <= www folder
     `  data         <= data folder
